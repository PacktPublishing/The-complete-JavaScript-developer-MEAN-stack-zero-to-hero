## About the Video Course
Learn all of the different aspects of full stack JavaScript development using the MEAN stack. We're not talking about any generators or MEAN frameworks here, we're talking about a full understanding of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. Throughout this course we'll show you how to use each of these technologies, and how to use them together. Build Great JavaScript Applications using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS 1.x and Node.js. The overall aim of the course is to enable to you confidently build all different types of application using the MEAN stack. To do this, the course is divided into four sections, each section focusing on a different goal. The four sections all work together building a full application, with an overall outcome of showing how to architect and build complete MEAN applications.
